Feed Reader Testing with Jasmine
===============================

Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 6: Feed Reader Testing

##Introduction
In this Project we are using the Jasmine behavior-driven development framework for Javascript to test for a variety of things when the script we are testing pulls in some RSS feeds from other sites. Our tests ensure that the feeds are defined, have a name, and are not empty. They test the menu appearance, that there are initial entries, and that the content changes whena feed is loaded.

##Instructions
1.  Open http://rawgit.com/maikasaguid/feedreader/master/index.html in your browser to run Jasmine tests.
2.  The Jasmine spec file can be found here: http://rawgit.com/maikasaguid/feedreader/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
